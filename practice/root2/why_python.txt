I want to learn Python to be able to extend my scientific skillset beyond benchwork. 
As an immunology student working with high-dimensional flow cytometry and scRNA seq dataset,
 I want to be able to independently analyze and understand the experimental dataset I am generating with a better standard of reproducibility. 
 I am hoping Python makes it easier to organize, analyze, and visualize my results compared to manual methods.
