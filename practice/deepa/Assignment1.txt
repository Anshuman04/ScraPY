I want to learn python because it's widely used and versatile programming language. It's widely used in my field of study - biotechnology and microbiology. Python will help me automate repetitive lab tasks like processing the experimental data/ data analysis and simulating microbial growth models. It also provides tools for analysing DNA, RNA, Protein sequensing data which are essential in modern research. Gaining these skills will not only support my work in lab but will also strengthen my professional growth in the field.
